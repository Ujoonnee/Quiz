문제
Given two integers A and B, A modulo B is the remainder when dividing A by B. For example, the numbers 7, 14, 27 and 38 become 1, 2, 0 and 2, modulo 3. Write a program that accepts 10 numbers as input and outputs the number of distinct numbers in the input, if the numbers are considered modulo 42.

입력
The input will contain 10 non-negative integers, each smaller than 1000, one per line. 

출력
Output the number of distinct values when considered modulo 42 on a single line.
